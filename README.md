# Brake Bible

The Brake Bible is a web application designed with press brake operators in mind. Various formulas but the primary function is to allows saving specific notes for a specific part, and with image upload. 

## Getting Started

I used XAMMP to help test the program while making it. It is now on a live server at https://brawer.dev/BrakeBible

There is a password associated with the app. Standard rights are given with "StockMFG" as the password (not currently very secure storage of this password). 

Download root folder to a location accessible to XAMMP. XAMMP document folder should be the root of this project, for instance. XAMMPP configuration may be required. 

### Prerequisites

A server on the development machine with PHP capabilities. Ability to connect to the database associated with the application. 

```
XAMMP is what I have used to test the application on the development machine.

## Deployment

Upload all files to a server with PHP, maintaining current file structure.
